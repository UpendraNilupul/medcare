# PDF Receipt Feature - Implementation Complete

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Fatal Error: Call to member function bind_param() on bool
**Problem**: The SQL query in `generate_receipt.php` was using `id` column instead of `appointment_id`
**Solution**: Updated the query to use the correct column name `appointment_id`

### 2. Database Column Mismatch
**Problem**: Primary key column was named `appointment_id` but code referenced `id`
**Solution**: Updated all references to use `appointment_id` consistently

### 3. Doctor Name Display Issue
**Problem**: Doctor names were showing as "Dr. Dr. Name" (double prefix)
**Solution**: Removed extra "Dr." prefix from display templates

### 4. Method Check Error
**Problem**: `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']` was undefined in CLI testing
**Solution**: Added null coalescing operator to handle CLI execution
